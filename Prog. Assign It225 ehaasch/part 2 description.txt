PART 2 Description

This program attempts to compare 2 values given by the user. If they are equal, it goes to one location. If it goes to another. If else, it goes to the final location. For my program, I got the comparing of equals to work. 

In addition, if the first value given by the user is smaller than the second, then the comparing smaller works (difference.) However, the rest of the program does not function correctly.

I was unable to deterimine the exact reason. However, I believe that the reason why it does not work may be that it is not reading the variables correctly in the main top portion of the program. I am unsure as to whether this is correct or not and don't really understand the IFLT and IFEQ statements in ijvm.
